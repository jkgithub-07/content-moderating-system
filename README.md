# content-moderating-system

A powerful and scalable Content Moderation System leveraging **Logistic Regression (LR)** for text moderation and **YOLOv8 / CNN** for image moderation, deployed on **AWS** for seamless integration and performance. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Text Moderation:**  
  - Uses **Logistic Regression (LR)** to detect offensive, harmful, or inappropriate text content.  
  - Trained with curated datasets to identify abusive language, spam, and other violations.  

- **Image Moderation:**  
  - Supports two models: **ResNet18** (for image classification).  
  - Detects violence, and other inappropriate visual content.  

- **AWS Deployment:**  
  - Scalable deployment using **AWS Lambda, EC2 , S3  **.  
  - Integration with **AWS S3** for image storage and retrieval.
  - Use of AWS SageMaker for training and testing image moderation model.
